            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>The following people were involved in the development of this game</p>
            <ul id="bullet">
                <li><a href="http://mfoot.com">Martin Foot</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Michael Kerby</a></li>

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>This game was designed to highlight to the wider public the energy issues
                involved in meeting the current targets set by the British Government for 2050.
                These targets involve the reduction of carbon emissions by 80% of that of 1990.
                By developing this game it was hoped that players would be able to simulate how they would attempt to meet these targets,
                whilst learning about both the potential and limitations the government have in place to achieve their goals.</p>
            <h3>UK 2050 Target</h3>
            <h4>Energy Act 2008</h4>
            <p>The Energy Act 2008 was given Royal Assent on 26 November 2008. It implements the legislative aspects of the Energy white paper 2007: ‘Meeting the energy challenge’. The Energy Act updates energy legislation to:</p>
            <ul id="bullet">
                <li>reflect the availability of new technologies (such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and emerging renewable technologies</li>
                <li>correspond with the UK's changing requirements for secure energy supply (such as offshore gas storage)</li>
                <li>protect our environment and the tax payer as our energy market changes</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Climate Change Act 2008</h4>
            <p>The UK has passed legislation which introduces the world’s first long-term legally binding framework to tackle the dangers of climate change.The Climate Change Bill was introduced into Parliament on 14 November 2007 and became law on 26 November 2008.The Climate Change Act creates a new approach to managing and responding to climate change in the UK, by:</p>
            <ul id="bullet">
                <li>setting ambitious, legally binding targets</li>
                <li>taking powers to help meet those targets</li>
                <li>strengthening the institutional framework</li>
                <li>enhancing the UK’s ability to adapt to the impact of climate change</li>
                <li>establishing clear and regular accountability to the UK Parliament and to the devolved legislatures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Energy Act 2010</h4>
            <p>On 8 April 2010, the Energy Bill received Royal Assent becoming Energy Act 2010. It implements some of the key measures required to deliver DECC's low carbon agenda.
                The Act includes provisions on:</p>

            <ul id="bullet">
                <li>Introducing a new CCS Incentive to support the construction of four commercial-scale CCS demonstration projects in the UK, and the retrofit of additional CCS capacity to these projects should it be required at a future point.</li>
                <li>Requiring the Government to prepare regular reports on the progress that has been made on the decarbonisation of electricity generation in Britain and the development and use of CCS.</li>
                <li>Introducing mandatory social price support : Tackling fuel poverty by lowering the energy bills of more of the most vulnerable consumers and giving greater guidance on the types of households eligible for support. These measures will be funded by requiring energy companies to make available at least £300 million per annum by 2013-14 on social support.</li>
                <li>Fairness of energy markets : Making it clear that Ofgem, in relation to their principal objective of protecting the interests of existing and future consumers, must: <ul>
                        <li>include the reduction of carbon emissions and the delivery of secure energy supplies in their assessment of the interests of consumers; and </li>
                        <li>step in proactively to protect the consumer interest as well as considering longer term actions to promote competition. </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Giving Ofgem additional powers, through the insertion of a Market Power Licence Condition in the licences of electricity generation companies, to prevent companies exploiting market power that may arise as a result of constrained capacity in the electricity transmission system.</li>
                <li>Extending the time limit within which Ofgem can impose financial penalties for breaches of licence conditions from 12 months to 5 years. </li>
                <li>Allowing the Government to set the period within which energy companies must inform customers of changes to their gas and electricity tariffs.</li>
                <li>Enabling the Secretary of State to address certain types of cross-subsidies between gas and electricity supply businesses should they impact unfairly on consumers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Energy Security and Green Economy Bill</h4>
            <p>The Energy Security and Green Economy Bill is being designed to provide for a step change in the provision of energy efficiency measures to homes and businesses, and make improvements to our framework to enable and secure, low carbon energy supplies and fair competition in the energy markets. The Bill seeks to provide for some of the key elements of the Coalition’s Programme for Government and its first Annual Energy Statement.</p>
            <p>More information on these and other legislation can be found on the DECC website shown below</p>
            <h3>Data Sources</h3>
            <p>Two main data sources were used extensively for reference to key data that has been used for the in game model. They are the following:</p>
