                        <div align="bottom">A wind farm.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>The UK's position in the world makes it one of the best locations for using renewable energy – we certainly get wind and occasionally some sun! In fact, in Europe, we get the most suitable weather for renewable energy systems to work.</p>
                    <p>The most common way of getting energy from the wind is through setting up 'Wind farms'. The first wind farm was set up in November 1991. In 2007, approximately 1.5% of UK electricity was generated by wind power (with a total of around 4.5% of UK electricity coming from all renewable sources. As of May 1 2009 there are 211 operational wind farms in the UK, with 2,434 turbines and 3,391 MW of installed capacity.</p>
                    <div class="image" id="infoImageRight">
                        <img src="images/infoWindMap.png" ></img>
                        <div align="bottom">Map of wind farms in UK.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>When they were first introduced wind farms were very expensive form of energy, however over the years, initial costs have fallen, and therefore the cost of getting electricity from the wind has dropped considerably.</p>
                    <p>The UK government, along with others around the globe have introduced initiatives and proposals to ensure more of our energy comes from renewable energy. The 2009 UK Budget included a significant boost for offshore wind power that could amount to £525m between 2011 and 2014. Fears had previously been expressed that large projects would be abandoned or mothballed because of the difficulties in raising finance. While the ground on which the turbines are positioned can still be used for agricultural purposes.</p>
                    <p>Wind power enables electricity to be produced in an environmentally friendly way – the turbines don't produce chemical or radioactive emissions. While the ground on which the turbines are positioned can still be used for agricultural purposes. If the turbines need to be taken down, there is no damage to the environment and no residues are left behind.</p>
                    <div class="image" id="infoImageLeft">
                        <img src="images/infoWindNIMBY.png"></img>
                        <div align="bottom">"Not in my back yard!"</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>However there are concerns from some people who are worried about wind farms being positioned in their area. The main worries are that they ruin the landscape – because they generally have to be positioned on hills to get the maximum benefits of the wind.</p>
                    <p>Wind farms can also be costly to maintain and electricity produced by this method is more expensive than that produced by other means. There are arguments put forth that the money would be better put into energy conservation. The noise generated from turbines has also been criticised by some people who live very close to the wind farms.</p>
                    <p>Certainly the number of wind farms in the UK is steadily increasing and as the industry grows, prices of generating electricity in this way should fall. In 2008 the UK became the country with the most offshore wind capacity, overtaking Denmark.</p>
                    <p>If the turbines need to be taken down, there is no damage to the environment and no residues are left behind.</p>
                    <p>With the passage of the EU Energy Directive in 2009 the UK Government agreed to an overall target of generating 15% of its energy supply from renewable sources by 2020. It is estimated that over 12,000 wind farms would be needed to make this goal achievable. The British Wind Energy Association estimates that this will require an ambitious 35-40% of the UK’s electricity to be generated from renewable sources by that date.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The use of solar power became very popular in the 1970s, but has fallen in and out of favour since depending on the potential savings when compared with fossil-fuel energy costs.</p>
                    <p>The photovoltaic effect is when photo cells convert sunlight directly into electricity - this has been used for sometime to power certain calculators, for example. Photovoltaic cells (PV's) can be used as roof tiles. They cover the roof of a house and take advantage of the light coming from the Sun. This is trapped by the cell and turned into electricity.</p>
                    <div class="image" id="infoImageLeft">
                        <img src="images/infoSolarDescription.png"></img>
                        <div align="bottom">The photovoltaic effect.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Another way to take advantage of the energy from the sun is to design buildings so they can collect the heat. They do this by designing the building sensibly and facing it in a way where it can use the sun to the maximum benefit. Large glass windows help with this, especially during the winter when the Sun is very low. In the summer, balconies and trees protect the building from getting too much heat.</p>
                    <p>More common method in the UK is using the benefits of the sun to heat our water pipes. Painting the thin pipes black and putting them in a 'greenhouse' type insulator can heat our water supply and therefore reduce the cost of using electricity to heat it.</p>
                    <div class="image" id="infoImageRight">
                        <img src="images/infoSolarWater.png"></img>
                        <div align="bottom">Heating water using solar energy.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>As well as the fact that energy from the Sun is readily available, there are many other benefits. By locating photovoltaic cells on top of houses, no extra land space is needed and they can also be situated in urban areas. The technology now needed is about 90% cheaper than it was in the 1970s. Houses with solar roof tiles can in fact generate more electricity than is needed at certain times in the day, and can sell this back to local electricity companies.</p>
                    <p>However the UK is behind many other countries in Europe and the rest of the World when it comes to using solar power technologies. In Japan and the USA, billions has been spent on developing PV over a number of years, and more recently, Germany has started to push lots of money into the development of it for projects there. China has pledged to throw its economic might behind a national solar plan and the government has committed to raising its share of renewable energy to 6%, from the current 1.5%.</p>

                <h3 id="accordionHeader"><a href="#" id="accordionTitle">Nuclear</a></h3>
                <div id="scroll">

                        <div align="bottom">Nuclear Power Plant.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p> Nuclear power is possibly the most contentious and emotive of all methods of energy production, due to the nature of the material involved and long term consequences of accidents. Nuclear power stations currently produce about 14% of Britain's electricity. There has been a significant drop in this figure since 2006 (around 20%) because several nuclear plants have been shut down for repairs for extended periods.</p>
                    <p>Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element, left over from Earth's formation. It can be used in nuclear power production because if a free neutron collides with the nucleus of a Uranium atom, the nucleus splits (fission) into two smaller atoms plus one free neutron. This free neutron can then cause another fission to occur (a chain reaction). As the two new atoms weigh less than the original Uranium atom, an enormous amount of energy is also released.</p>
                    <p>The energy produced by the splitting of the Uranium nucleus in the power plant (the reactor) is used as a heat source. This turns water into steam, which drives a turbine. The turbine spins a generator to produce electricity. The reactor is sealed inside concrete and steel to prevent radioactive gases and fluids leaking from the plant.</p>
                    <p>Calder Hall, Cumbria, was the world's first nuclear power station to produce electricity. It opened in 1956. Currently there are nineteen reactors operating in Britain with many due to close over the coming years.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The British Government confirmed in 2008 that it would back a new generation of nuclear power stations. John Hutton, former Secretary of State for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform told Parliament that the case in favour of nuclear power was “compelling” and that he hoped the first new station would be up and running well before 2020.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Proponents of nuclear power say that, without it, the UK will not be able to meet its energy demands whilst preventing carbon dioxide emissions from increasing. They also argue that nuclear power has a crucial role to play in helping the UK to avoid becoming reliant on oil and gas imports from unstable countries.</p>
                    <p>The critics of nuclear power argue that it has not traditionally been very clean. Waste from the power plants is toxic for many centuries and there is no safe way to store it permanently or dispose of it. Transporting nuclear fuel can also be risky and there remains the risk of an accident such as that which affected Chernobyl in 1986.</p>
                    <p>The UK would not be alone if it decided to opt for more nuclear power stations. Nearly all countries have been affected by rises in oil and gas prices, and many are looking for alternatives. Among countries currently building new plants, or considering doing so, are the US, Russia, Japan, India and China.</p>

                <h3 id="accordionHeader"><a href="#" id="accordionTitle">Geothermal</a></h3>
                <div id="scroll">
                    <p>Geothermal simply means 'Earth's heat'.The centre of the Earth is extremely hot, current estimates are 5,500C at the core just over six and a half thousand kilometres below the crust. This is about as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
                    <div class="image" id="infoImageLeft">
                        <img src="images/infoGeothermal.png"></img>
                        <div align="bottom">Geothermal station in Southampton.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>It is not surprising therefore, that even the upper 3 metres of the Earth's surface stay at a nearly constant 10-16C throughout the year.</p>
                    <p>Geothermal heat found near the surface of the Earth can be used directly for heating buildings and for a number of commercial and industrial uses. The relatively constant temperature of the top 15 metres of the Earth's surface (or ground water) can also be used to heat or cool buildings indirectly. The pump uses a series of pipes to circulate fluid through the warm ground.</p>
                    <p>In the winter when the ground is warmer than the buildings above, the liquid absorbs heat from the ground, which is then concentrated and transferred to the buildings. This can also be used to heat domestic water. In the summer, when the ground is cooler, the pump transfers heat from the buildings back into the ground.</p>
                    <p>There are three types of power plant that can convert geothermal energy to electricity, depending on the temperature of the geothermal fluid used. All three use a turbine that is driven by steam, which then drives a generator to produce electricity.</p>
                    <div class="image" id="infoImageRight">
                        <img src="images/infoGeothermalHowTo.png"></img>
                        <div align="bottom">How it works.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Humans have used geothermal energy for thousands of years, using hot springs initially for cooking and building reservoirs around springs to create shrines and bathing complexes such as those built at Bath by the Romans.</p>
                    <p>The world's first District Heating system was built in 1892 in Idaho, USA and piped hot water from springs to town buildings. The first geothermal power plant was built in Ladarello in Italy in 1904.</p>
                    <p>In using geothermal energy, no fossil fuel burning is required. Geothermal power plants emit only excess steam and very few trace gases (1000-2000 times less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel power plants), they take up very little land compared to traditional fossil-fuel plants and advanced drilling techniques minimise the impact of drilling wells.</p>
                    <p>The electricity produced is also more 'available', as fossil-fuelled power plants produce electricity 65-75% of the time compared to 90% from geothermal power plants. When a heat pump is used to provide domestic heating, the savings on electricity can outweigh the cost of installing and running the system. Where geothermal energy is used in agriculture (such as to heat greenhouses) heating costs can be cut by up to 80%. The cost of electricity from geothermal power plants is slowly becoming competitive with that from traditional power plants.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Hydro-electric power is the most common form of generating electricity from water at the moment. Generally what happens is a reservoir is built with a dam in it, a mass of water is held back by the dam, and then suddenly released all at once, sending the water through a turbine at great force.</p>
                    <p>This kind of system used to be widespread before we started using engines. Hydro-electricity powered things like flour mills and was also used to power machinery. However, these were replaced by engines when fuel to run them was very cheap.</p>
                    <p>Hydro-electric power is pollution free and safe once it's up and running, although in creating it there can be tremendous disruption and upset to the environment, animals and nearby residents.</p>
                    <p>Hydro-electric power supplies about 20% of world electricity. Norway produces almost all of its electricity from hydro whilst Iceland and Austria produce over 70% of their electricity requirements from hydro plants. The greatest restriction to large extension of hydro-electric power in the UK is a lack of suitable sites.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Tidal power however works by using the gravitational pull of the moon, which creates tidal rises and falls, to produce energy. A recent inquiry into harnessing tidal power in the Severn Estuary has rejected plans for a multi-million barrage between Weston-super-Mare and Cardiff. The commission’s inquiry said a larger Severn barrage would “do serious damage to the estuary by wiping out around 80% of the ‘inter-tidal habitat’.”</p>
                    <p>There is a large-scale tidal power scheme on the River Rance near St Malo in France, which helps produce a considerable amount of electricity. Others in Russia, Canada and China have also been very productive and economical.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>In the UK a tidal barrage was proposed to cross the Severn river near Bristol but was described as having "no strategic case" to build here. Other locations are now being considered</p>
                    <p>The third way of getting power from our waters is by using the energy created by waves. This mass of kinetic energy can be captured quite effectively, and the UK is potentially a good location for such an idea. But while other sources of renewable energy – such as wind and solar – have been widely adopted in recent years, wave energy has been slow to take off.</p>
                    <p>There are several ways of capturing the energy from waves, and some of them, such as building dams or pipes for the water to go up, can be quite expensive, and also could be disruptive to other industry, such as fishing.</p>

                <div id="scroll">
                    <p>Natural gas is a vital component of the world's supply of energy. It is one of the cleanest, safest, and most useful of all energy sources. Despite its importance, however, there are many misconceptions about natural gas. For instance, the word 'gas' itself has a variety of different uses, and meanings. When we fuel our car, we put 'gas' in it. However, the gasoline that goes into your vehicle, while a fossil fuel itself, is very different from natural gas. The 'gas' in the common barbecue is actually propane, which, while closely associated and commonly found in natural gas, is not really natural gas itself. While commonly grouped in with other fossil fuels and sources of energy, there are many characteristics of natural gas that make it unique. Below is a bit of background information about natural gas, what it is exactly, how it is formed, and how it is found in nature.</p>
                    <div class="image" id="infoImageRight">

                    </div>
                    <p>Natural gas, in itself, might be considered an uninteresting gas - it is colorless, shapeless, and odorless in its pure form. Quite uninteresting - except that natural gas is combustible, abundant in the United States and when burned it gives off a great deal of energy and few emissions. Unlike other fossil fuels, natural gas is clean burning and emits lower levels of potentially harmful byproducts into the air. We require energy constantly, to heat our homes, cook our food, and generate our electricity. It is this need for energy that has elevated natural gas to such a level of importance in our society, and in our lives.</p>
                    <p>Natural gas is a combustible mixture of hydrocarbon gases. While natural gas is formed primarily of methane, it can also include ethane, propane, butane and pentane. The composition of natural gas can vary widely, but below is a chart outlining the typical makeup of natural gas before it is refined.</p>
                    <p>In its purest form, such as the natural gas that is delivered to your home, it is almost pure methane. Methane is a molecule made up of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms, and is referred to as CH4.  The distinctive “rotten egg” smell that we often associate with natural gas is actually an odorant called mercaptan that is added to the gas before it is delivered to the end-user.  Mercaptan aids in detecting any leaks. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Natural gas has many uses, residentially, commercially, and industrially. Found in reservoirs underneath the earth, natural gas is often associated with oil deposits. Production companies search for evidence of these reservoirs by using sophisticated technology that helps to find the location of the natural gas, and drill wells in the earth where it is likely to be found. Click on the link to learn more about the new technologies and their environmental impact. Once brought from underground, the natural gas is refined to remove impurities such as water, other gases, sand, and other compounds. Some hydrocarbons are removed and sold separately, including propane and butane. Other impurities are also removed, such as hydrogen sulfide (the refining of which can produce sulfur, which is then also sold separately). After refining, the clean natural gas is transmitted through a network of pipelines, thousands of miles of which exist in the United States alone. From these pipelines, natural gas is delivered to its point of use.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. When burned, it produces emissions that contribute to global warming, create acid rain and pollute water. With all of the hoopla surrounding nuclear energy, hydropower and biofuels, you might be forgiven for thinking that grimy coal is finally on its way out.</p>
                    <p>But coal is no sooty remnant of the Industrial Revolution -- it generates half of the electricity in the United States and will likely continue to do so as long as it's cheap and plentiful. Clean coal technology seeks to reduce harsh environmental effects by using multiple technologies to clean coal and contain its emissions.</p>
                    <p>Coal is a fossil fuel composed primarily of carbons and hydrocarbons. Its ingredients help make plastics, tar and fertilizers. A coal derivative, a solidified carbon called coke, melts iron ore and reduces it to create steel. But most coal -- 92 percent of the U.S. supply -- goes into power production. Electric companies and businesses with power plants burn coal to make the steam that turns turbines and generates electricity.</p>

                    <p>When coal burns, it releases carbon dioxide and other emissions in flue gas, the billowing clouds you see pouring out of smoke stacks. Some clean coal technologies purify the coal before it burns. One type of coal preparation, coal washing, removes unwanted minerals by mixing crushed coal with a liquid and allowing the impurities to separate and settle.</p>

                    <p>Other systems control the coal burn to minimize emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates. Wet scrubbers, or flue gas desulfurization systems, remove sulfur dioxide, a major cause of acid rain, by spraying flue gas with limestone and water. The mixture reacts with the sulfur dioxide to form synthetic gypsum, a component of drywall.</p>
                    <p>Low-NOx (nitrogen oxide) burners reduce the creation of nitrogen oxides, a cause of ground-level ozone, by restricting oxygen and manipulating the combustion process. Electrostatic precipitators remove particulates that aggravate asthma and cause respiratory ailments by charging particles with an electrical field and then capturing them on collection plates.</p>
                    <p>Gasification avoids burning coal altogether. With integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems, steam and hot pressurized air or oxygen combine with coal in a reaction that forces carbon molecules apart. The resulting syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is then cleaned and burned in a gas turbine to make electricity. The heat energy from the gas turbine also powers a steam turbine. Since IGCC power plants create two forms of energy, they have the potential to reach a fuel efficiency of 50 percent.</p>
                    <p>In 2010, the UK government has announced new regulations that prohibit building any new coal power plants, if those plants don't have carbon capture and storage incorporated into them.</p>

                        <div align="bottom">How Carbon Capture works.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS), alternatively referred to as Carbon capture and sequestration, is a means of mitigating the contribution of fossil fuel emissions to global warming, based on capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources such as fossil fuel power plants, and storing it in such a way that it does not enter the atmosphere. It can also be used to describe the scrubbing of CO2 from ambient air as a geoengineering technique.</p>
                    <p>"Carbon capture and storage" has also been used to describe biological capture and subsequent storage of atmospheric CO2, such as the burial of "biochar"—the end product of "pyrolysis", the decomposition of organic material by heat in the absence of oxygen. However, the term is more conventionally applied to non-biological methods of capturing carbon dioxide from combustion at the source.</p>
                    <p>Although CO2 has been injected into geological formations for various purposes, the long term storage of CO2 is a relatively new concept. The first commercial example is Weyburn in 2000; integrated pilot-scale CCS power plant was to begin operating in September 2008 in the eastern German power plant Schwarze Pumpe run by utility Vattenfall, in the hope of answering questions about technological feasibility and economic efficiency.</p>

                        <div align="bottom">Underground storage in Germany.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>CCS applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80-90% compared to a plant without CCS. The IPCC estimates that the economic potential of CCS could be between 10% and 55% of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100.</p>
                    <p>Capturing and compressing CO2 requires much energy and would increase the fuel needs of a coal-fired plant with CCS by 25%-40%. These and other system costs are estimated to increase the cost of energy from a new power plant with CCS by 21-91%. These estimates apply to purpose-built plants near a storage location; applying the technology to preexisting plants or plants far from a storage location will be more expensive. However, recent industry reports suggest that with successful research, development and deployment, sequestered coal-based electricity generation in 2025 will cost less than unsequestered coal-based electricity generation today.</p>

                    </div><p>Storage of the CO2 is envisaged either in deep geological formations, in deep ocean masses, or in the form of mineral carbonates. In the case of deep ocean storage, there is a risk of greatly increasing the problem of ocean acidification, a problem that also stems from the excess of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere and oceans. Geological formations are currently considered the most promising sequestration sites. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) reported that North America has enough storage capacity at its current rate of production for more than 900 years worth of carbon dioxide. A general problem is that long term predictions about submarine or underground storage security are very difficult and uncertain and CO2 might leak from the storage into the atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>When applied on plants which use biomass, the process is known as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage. This has the potential to be used as a negative carbon emission technique, and is by some regarded as geoengineering.</p>
